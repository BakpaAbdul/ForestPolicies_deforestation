# This script match the forest policies with ipums_id. 
# It uses spatial intersection to identify which forest policies overlap with IPUMS admin2 units and assigns the corresponding ipums_id to each policy.
# It also filters out small overlaps where the intersected area is less than 20% of the original policy area. this is to ensure that only significant overlaps are considered. 
# Small overlaps may be  cause my small changes in admisnistrative units counts or minor inaccuracies in the spatial data.
